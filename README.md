# y-router

A Cloudflare Worker that translates between Anthropic's Claude API and OpenAI-compatible APIs, enabling you to use Claude Code with OpenRouter and other OpenAI-compatible providers.

## Features

- üîÑ **API Translation**: Converts between Anthropic and OpenAI API formats
- üåê **Multiple Deployments**: Supports Cloudflare Workers and Google Cloud Run
- üì° **Streaming Support**: Handles both streaming and non-streaming responses
- üöÄ **Easy Setup**: One-line installation script available
- üîß **Flexible Configuration**: Support for multiple providers and models
- üéØ **Claude Code Ready**: Optimized for Claude Code integration

## Quick Usage

### One-line Install (Recommended)
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://cc.yovy.app/install.sh)"
```

This script will automatically:
- Install Node.js (if needed)
- Install Claude Code
- Configure your environment with OpenRouter or Moonshot
- Set up all necessary environment variables

### Manual Setup

**Step 1:** Install Claude Code
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**Step 2:** Get OpenRouter API key from [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)

**Step 3:** Configure environment variables in your shell config (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
# For quick testing, you can use our shared instance. For daily use, deploy your own instance for better reliability.
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://cc.yovy.app"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"
```

**Optional:** Configure specific models (browse models at [openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models)):
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="moonshotai/kimi-k2"
export ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL="google/gemini-2.5-flash"
```

**Step 4:** Reload your shell and run Claude Code:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
claude
```

That's it! Claude Code will now use OpenRouter's models through y-router.

### Multiple Configurations

To maintain multiple Claude Code configurations for different providers or models, use shell aliases:

```bash
# Example aliases for different configurations
alias c1='ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://cc.yovy.app" ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-openrouter-key" ANTHROPIC_MODEL="moonshotai/kimi-k2" ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL="google/gemini-2.5-flash" claude'
alias c2='ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://api.moonshot.ai/anthropic/" ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-moonshot-key" ANTHROPIC_MODEL="kimi-k2-0711-preview" ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL="moonshot-v1-8k" claude'
```

Add these aliases to your shell config file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`), then use `c1` or `c2` to switch between configurations.

## Deployment Options

### Cloudflare Workers (Recommended)

1. **Clone and deploy:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/y-router.git
   cd y-router
   npm install -g wrangler
   wrangler deploy
   ```

2. **Set environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Optional: defaults to https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
   wrangler secret put OPENROUTER_BASE_URL
   ```

3. **Configure Claude Code:**
   - Set API endpoint to your deployed Worker URL
   - Use your OpenRouter API key
   - Enjoy access to Claude models via OpenRouter!

### Google Cloud Run

1. **Deploy to Cloud Run:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/y-router.git
   cd y-router
   npm run deploy:cloud-run
   ```

2. **Set environment variables:**
   ```bash
   gcloud run services update y-router --set-env-vars OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
   ```

### Local Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:local
   ```

3. **Test with curl:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/messages \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "x-api-key: your-openrouter-key" \
     -d '{
       "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
       "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}],
       "max_tokens": 100
     }'
   ```

## GitHub Actions Integration

To use Claude Code in GitHub Actions workflows, add the environment variable to your workflow:

```yaml
env:
  ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL }}
```

Set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to `https://cc.yovy.app` in your repository secrets.

### Example Workflows

This repository includes example GitHub Actions workflows:

- **[Interactive Claude Code](.github/workflows/claude.yml)** - Responds to @claude mentions in issues and pull requests
- **[Automated Code Review](.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml)** - Automatic PR reviews using Claude Code

To use these workflows:
1. Copy the workflow files to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Set the required secrets in your repository settings
3. The workflows will automatically trigger based on their configured events

## How It Works

y-router acts as a translation layer that:
- Accepts requests in Anthropic's API format (`/v1/messages`)
- Converts them to OpenAI's chat completions format
- Forwards to OpenRouter (or any OpenAI-compatible API)
- Translates the response back to Anthropic's format
- Supports both streaming and non-streaming responses

## Perfect for Claude Code + OpenRouter

This allows you to use [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) with OpenRouter's vast selection of models by:
1. Pointing Claude Code to your y-router deployment
2. Using your OpenRouter API key
3. Accessing Claude models available on OpenRouter through Claude Code's interface

## API Reference

    "max_tokens": 100
  }'
```

### Streaming Response

```bash
curl -X POST https://cc.yovy.app/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: your-openrouter-key" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
